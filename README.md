# Blockchain
🆘 this is still under heavy development and probably wont work just yet [but that doesn't mean you can't help](#contributions--suggestions)! 🆘
<!-- coming soon! [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/anthcor/blockchain.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/anthcor/blockchain) -->
Golang blockchain implementation using [Minimum Viable Blockchain](https://artsec.hackpad.com/Blockchains-and-Bitcoins-mR2wlQ4KbVQ).

### Keys
The Blockchain uses ECDSA (224 bits) keys.

When a user first joins the blockchain a random key will be generated.

Keys are encoded using base58.

Given x, y as the components of the public key, the key is generated as following:
```go
base58(BigInt(append(x as bytes, y as bytes)))
```

### Proof of work
In order to sign a transaction and send it to the network, proof of work is required.

Proof of work is also required for block generation.

### Protocol
The blockchain runs on port `9191` and uses TCP to handle connections among peers.

##### Message

* Message type (1 byte)
```go
const (
	MESSAGE_GET_NODES = iota + 20
	MESSAGE_SEND_NODES
	MESSAGE_GET_TRANSACTION
	MESSAGE_SEND_TRANSACTION
	MESSAGE_GET_BLOCK
	MESSAGE_SEND_BLOCK
)
```

* Options (4 bytes): Data specific
* Data (n bytes): Data specific

##### Transaction

* Header:
	* From (80 bytes): Origin public key
	* To (80 bytes): Destination public key
	* Timestamp (4 bytes): `int32 UNIX timestamp`
 	* Payload Hash (32 bytes): `sha256(payloadData)`
	* Payload Length (4 bytes): `len(payloadData`
	* Nonce (4 bytes): Proof of work

* Signature (80 bytes): `signed(sha256(header))`
* Payload data (Payload Length bytes): raw data

##### Block

* Header:
	* Origin (80 bytes): Origin public key
	* Timestamp (4 bytes): `int32 UNIX timestamp`
	* Previous block (32 bytes): `sha256(previous block header)`
	* Merkel Root (32 Bytes): `sha256(transaction hashes)`
	* Nonce (4 bytes): `int32 UNIX timestamp`

* Signature (80 bytes): `signed(sha256(header))`
* Block transactions
